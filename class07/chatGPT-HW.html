        Sure, here are a few homework assignments related to JavaScript functions and arrays:
<ul>
<li>Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the sum of all the numbers in the array.</li>
<li>Write a function that takes an array of strings as input and returns the longest string in the array.</li>
<li>Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array containing only the even numbers from the original array.</li>
<li>Write a function that takes an array of strings as input and returns a new array containing only the strings that start with the letter "A".</li>
<li>Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the highest and lowest numbers in the array as an object with properties "highest" and "lowest".</li>
</ul>
These assignments should provide you with some practice using
<script>
    function createarr(a,b){
        let arr = [];
        for (let index = a; index <= b; index++) {
            arr.push(index);            
        }
        return arr;
    }
    function sum(n) {
        let total = 0;
    //   console.log(n);
    n.forEach(s => {
        // total = total + s;
        total += s;
    }); 
    alert("total is " + total) 
    }
//[1,2,3,4.......100]
    sum(createarr(1,100))
</script>
